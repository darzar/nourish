           It gives me great pleasure to strongly recommend Diana as a nutritionist. I started going to see Diana because I felt my family had kind of lost our way in what we were eating. I am a pretty good cook but realized that I was not perhaps providing nutritionally balanced meals for my family. Diana spent a lot of time with me, finding out about our diet and lifestyle, without judging or criticizing. She provided me with a wealth of information, suggestions and easy recipes and has always been on hand, at the end of an email, to answer queries and give encouragement. Above all, she is a really charming person and extremely approachable. I cannot say enough good things about Diana and what she has done for my family.</br>

            I was followed by Diana for about 8 months. I was immediately struck by her professionalism and understanding of the human body. She would immediately update my program based on progress, new symptoms and my personal situation. She always found solutions to accommodate my needs of the moment and busy schedule.
            She provided delicious new recipes and ideas which were actually doable with the appliances I already had in my kitchen and with ingredients readily available. Not only did I learn new recipes, but I also learnt an easy to maintain new lifestyle which has helped me heal both physically and mentally.
            I would highly recommend Diana for anyone wanting to make both small and large changes in their diets and lifestyles as she will definitely find a solution that meets your current needs and future ambitions!</br>
