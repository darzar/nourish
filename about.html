                            •   MEdSpecEd.</br>
                            •   Fully certified Nutritional Therapist and Nutritional Coach (IINH)</br>
                            •   Level Three Raw Food Chef and Certified Food Educator (Pure Joy Academy, USA)</br>
                            •   co author ‘Expat Teens Talk’</br></br>

                             Diana began her teaching career in 1991 as a Montessori Classroom Teacher. She went on to qualify and work as a Dyslexia Consultant and supported students in both private practice and in International Schools. </br></br>
                             As a lifelong learner, she pursued and completed both her post graduate degree and Master’s Degree in Education, Special Education and furthered her career by working with students with a wider range of Specific Learning Difficulties, including Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, ADD/HD, Dyspraxia, Asperger’s, Autism and undiagnosed difficulties. She continued to work in a private practice setting with a collaborative team of specialists to help students maximize their overall learning potential.</br></br>
                             Diana then joined a team of specialists put together to develop the Learning Support Department of a 3000+ population international school in Singapore. </br></br>
                             Throughout her career as an Educational Therapist she concluded there were more ways to support students with Specific Learning Difficulties and went on to commit to and complete a three-year qualification as a Nutritional Therapist, and then continued her studies to qualify as a Raw Food Chef.</br></br>
                             Diana is now working on establishing a collaborative practice in the greater Geneva area which aims to meet the Educational, Developmental, Psychological, Nutritional, Behavioural needs and much more to maximize support for students with differing needs and their families.</br></br>

                             On a more personal side, Diana is a mother of three young adults, ages 19, 20, 22, who were raised as expatriates. As a family they lived in eight countries and experienced a total of eleven household moves. While raising international children and working with International students, Diana realised the needs of ‘Expat teens’ differed from those raised in a monoculture environment. Her interest and passion for learning led her to research, work on and co author ‘Expat Teens Talk’, with Dr. Lisa Pittman. As a lifelong expat, Diana knows what it means to be adaptable and flexible to change. </br></br>

                             In addition, she will conduct a comprehensive dietary analysis alongside a detailed client health history to determine how to maximize each individuals learning potential by advising specific and necessary dietary changes to support optimal brain functioning. </br></br>

                             Diana has a committed passion to finding solutions to support children in  ‘learning to learn’. Working in a one on one capacity enables Diana to work closely with your child in working towards overcoming specific difficulties while increasing self confidence, self esteem and developing a positive and motivated attitude towards learning.</br></br>
